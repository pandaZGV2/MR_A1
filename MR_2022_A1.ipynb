        "Point clouds are a collection of points that represent a 3D shape or feature. Each point has its own set of X, Y and Z coordinates and in some cases additional attributes. A popular way to obtain this is by photogrammetry, though here we will use LiDAR data.\n",
        "\n",
        "LiDAR is a remote sensing process which collects measurements used to create 3D models and maps of objects and environments. Using ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared light, LiDAR gauges spatial relationships and shapes by measuring the time it takes for signals to bounce off objects and return to the scanner.\n",

        "    \n",
        "The point cloud obtained is with respect to the LiDAR frame. The poses however, are in the camera frame. If we want to combine the point clouds from various frames, we need to bring them to the camera frame. \n",
